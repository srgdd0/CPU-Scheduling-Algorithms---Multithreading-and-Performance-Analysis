# CPU Scheduling Algorithms - Multithreading and Performance Analysis

CPU scheduling algorithms are essential in operating systems to allocate CPU time to processes and threads. These algorithms aim to balance system performance by reducing response time, increasing throughput, and optimizing resource utilization.

In the first program discussed earlier, Round Robin (RR) was used as the CPU scheduling algorithm. This algorithm assigns a fixed time slice or quantum to each process, allowing each process to execute for a specific duration before being preempted by the next process in the queue. This approach ensures that each process is given a fair opportunity to execute and prevents any process from monopolizing the CPU.

In the second program, Multilevel Queue Scheduling was used as the CPU scheduling algorithm. This algorithm divides processes into separate queues based on their priority or type, with each queue being processed in turn. Processes with higher priority are assigned a higher quantum, while processes with lower priority are assigned a lower quantum, ensuring that high-priority processes are executed more frequently.

Both RR and Multilevel Queue Scheduling are examples of preemptive scheduling algorithms, meaning that the CPU can be preempted or interrupted during the execution of a process. This ensures that all processes are given a fair opportunity to execute and prevents any process from monopolizing the CPU.

Other common CPU scheduling algorithms include First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling. FCFS assigns CPU time to the first process that arrives and executes it until completion. SJF assigns CPU time to the process with the shortest expected execution time, while Priority Scheduling assigns CPU time to the process with the highest priority.

-   a. Multithreading was incorporated into each scheduling algorithm by dividing the tasks into smaller chunks and executing them simultaneously across multiple threads. In Round Robin (RR), each task was assigned a fixed time slice, and each thread was allocated a portion of the tasks to execute. In Multilevel Queue Scheduling, tasks were divided into separate queues based on their priority or type, with each queue being processed in turn by a separate thread. This approach allowed each thread to execute tasks without being blocked by other threads, resulting in a more efficient use of system resources.

-   b. The multithreaded scheduling algorithms performed significantly better than their single-threaded counterparts in terms of response time and throughput. The use of multithreading allowed the programs to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, resulting in faster completion times and improved performance. In the Round Robin program, for example, the use of multithreading reduced the response time and improved the throughput by allowing multiple tasks to execute simultaneously. Similarly, in the Multilevel Queue Scheduling program, the use of multithreading allowed tasks to be processed in parallel, resulting in improved performance and reduced wait times.

-   c. The results of the multithreaded scheduling algorithms can be analyzed in terms of the scheduling criteria, which include response time, throughput, and resource utilization. In both programs, the use of multithreading improved response time and throughput by allowing multiple tasks to execute simultaneously. Additionally, the use of multithreading reduced resource utilization by allowing each thread to execute tasks independently, reducing contention for system resources.

In conclusion, the incorporation of multithreading into scheduling algorithms can significantly improve system performance by reducing response time, increasing throughput, and optimizing resource utilization. The use of multithreading allows tasks to be executed simultaneously across multiple threads, resulting in faster completion times and improved performance. The performance gains of the multithreaded scheduling algorithms can be analyzed in terms of the scheduling criteria, with improvements observed in response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
