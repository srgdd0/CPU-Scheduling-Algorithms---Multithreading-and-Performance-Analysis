# CPU Scheduling Algorithms - Multithreading and Performance Analysis

CPU scheduling algorithms are essential in operating systems to allocate CPU time to processes and threads. These algorithms aim to balance system performance by reducing response time, increasing throughput, and optimizing resource utilization.

In the first program discussed earlier, Round Robin (RR) was used as the CPU scheduling algorithm. This algorithm assigns a fixed time slice or quantum to each process, allowing each process to execute for a specific duration before being preempted by the next process in the queue. This approach ensures that each process is given a fair opportunity to execute and prevents any process from monopolizing the CPU.

In the second program, Multilevel Queue Scheduling was used as the CPU scheduling algorithm. This algorithm divides processes into separate queues based on their priority or type, with each queue being processed in turn. Processes with higher priority are assigned a higher quantum, while processes with lower priority are assigned a lower quantum, ensuring that high-priority processes are executed more frequently.

Both RR and Multilevel Queue Scheduling are examples of preemptive scheduling algorithms, meaning that the CPU can be preempted or interrupted during the execution of a process. This ensures that all processes are given a fair opportunity to execute and prevents any process from monopolizing the CPU.

Other common CPU scheduling algorithms include First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling. FCFS assigns CPU time to the first process that arrives and executes it until completion. SJF assigns CPU time to the process with the shortest expected execution time, while Priority Scheduling assigns CPU time to the process with the highest priority.

In conclusion, CPU scheduling algorithms are essential to ensure optimal system performance in operating systems and multitasking systems. Different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, and the selection of the algorithm depends on the requirements of the system and the nature of the tasks being executed. RR and Multilevel Queue Scheduling are two common preemptive scheduling algorithms that aim to balance performance and optimize resource utilization.
